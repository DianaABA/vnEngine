# ChakraHearts Zero

A minimal, clean app to smoke-test the Visual Novel engine + web renderer.

## Run

```powershell
npm run dev -w chakrahearts-zero
```

Opens http://localhost:3100 and renders a tiny script (two lines → choice → end).

## Purpose

- Validate engine upgrades quickly end-to-end.
- Provide a simple template for trying the `@vn/core` + `@vn/renderer-web` integration.
